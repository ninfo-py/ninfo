nInfo
=====

nInfo is a tool and framework (and lots of plugins) for gathering information on any of
the following:

 * IP Address (v4 or v6)
 * MAC Address
 * Hostname
 * Username

It consists of multiple plugin classes that implement a `get_info` function.
The classes contain metadata for acceptable arguments, and if
they are relevant for internal and or external hosts.

The tool
========

Listing plugins
---------------

    $ ninfo -l
    Name                 Title                Description
    cif                  CIF                  Collective Intelligence Framework
    cymruwhois           Cymru Whois          Cymru Whois lookup
    geoip                GeoIP                GeoIP
    google_safebrowsing  Google Safe Browsing Google Safe Browsing check
    ....

Getting information
-------------------

Silly example, run two plugins against two addreses:

    $ ninfo -p geoip -p cymruwhois 8.8.8.8 4.2.2.2
    === 8.8.8.8 === 
    *** Cymru Whois (Cymru Whois lookup) ***
    15169 US 8.8.8.0/24 GOOGLE - Google Inc.

    *** GeoIP (GeoIP) ***
    US - United States

    === 4.2.2.2 === 
    *** Cymru Whois (Cymru Whois lookup) ***
    3356 US 4.0.0.0/9 LEVEL3 Level 3 Communications

    *** GeoIP (GeoIP) ***
    US - United States


Writing A plugin
----------------

Here's a plugin:

```python
from ninfo import PluginBase

class fun_plugin(PluginBase):
    """This plugin returns something cool!"""

    name        =  'fun'
    title       =  'Fun Plugin'
    description =  'Happy Fun time'
    cache_timeout   =  60*2
    types   =    ['ip','hostname']

    #def setup(self):
    #    #libraries should be lazy imported in setup. This is only called once.
    #    import mybackendlibrary
    #    self.client = mybackendlibrary.Client()

    def get_info(self, arg):
        #should always return a dictionary, even for a single value
        #multiple values are the norm, and allow values to be added without breakage
        result = 'hello %s' % arg
        return { "result": result }

plugin_class = fun_plugin
```

If installed, this plugin can be run as follows:

    >>> from ninfo import Ninfo
    >>> p = Ninfo()
    >>> print p.get_info('fun', 'justin.rules')
    {'result': 'hello justin.rules'}

I had to include a '.' in the argument, because without it, ninfo will assume
the argument is a 'user' and not an 'ip' or a 'hostname', and it will not run
the plugin.

Plugins are installed and located using entry_points. If the above class was in a python module
called fun_plugin, it would be installed by the following in setup.py:

```python
...
py_modules = [ "fun_plugin"],
entry_points = {
    'ninfo.plugin': [
        'fun = fun_plugin',
    ]
...
```

Plugin Metadata
---------------

* Strings
 * \_\_doc\_\_ - The python docstring of the class is used as the long_description for the plugin.
 * name - The name of the plugin. Can be anything, but keeping it limited to [a-z_] is recommended.
 * title - The title of the plugin. This is what is actually displayed to the user.
 * description - Short description of the plugin.
* cache_timeout - timeout in seconds that this plugin should be cached in
      memcache, and the max-age parameter sent by the web interface.
* types - A list of one or more of 'mac', 'ip', 'hostname', 'username'.
* local - if False, this plugin will not be ran against local hosts.
* remote - if False, this plugin will not be ran against remote hosts.

Cloned Plugins
--------------

Multiple instances of a plugin can be created by adding another section in the
configuration file and optionally overriding the plugin metadata:

    [plugin:geoip]
    path = GeoIP.dat

    [plugin:geoipcity]
    clone = geoip
    path = GeoIPCity.dat
    title = City GeoIP
    description = City Level GeoIP
